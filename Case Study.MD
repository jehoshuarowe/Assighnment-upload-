<span style="color:Grey;font-weight:700;font-size:15px">
What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
</span>
Reynolds realized that managing a portfolio with instruments such as stocks and ETFs, where there was a price difference would sometimes move out of line, thus creating arbitrage trading opportunities. As more ETF instruments were created Reynolds and his partners wasted no time seizing on these opportunities. But with this new form of trading there started to be problems as followed; The stock and ETF price would fluctuate violently at times giving a very small window for execution, but not only that but finding the best developers to do this was difficult.

<span style="color:Grey;font-weight:700;font-size:15px">
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)
</span> 

To solve this problems they they start to implement the laguage OCaml. Now you may ask why wouldnt Jane street Capital just use something thats optimized for speed like C# or C++ or C+/C as many other Hedging giants at the time use this languages as there go to. Rey Believed he wanted the best and ONLY the best developers. So he bleive;

	_“If a company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those who cared enough to learn it.”_

<span style="color:Grey;font-weight:700;font-size:15px">
What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
</span>

The financial domain Jane Street Capital is a part of is in the capital sector, classified being a hedge fund.

<span style="color:Grey;font-weight:700;font-size:15px">
What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
</span>

Over the past 5-10 years, the financial sector has been preposterously focusing on the outperformance and the continuous growth of alternative investments. Aside from that, nowadays these big companies are looking to outsource as many activities ranging from; accounting, compliance, marketing, research, and many other investment-related activities giving more attention to opportunities in portfolio diversification. As these practices are becoming the norm this allows for much smaller, mid-size, and even the big giants to offer lower costs to their products, allowing them to run more effectively and efficiently. As technology is advancing at an exponential rate one thing that this sector has done its best to take advantage of is the use of Machine learning and artificial intelligence. By using these methods in this financial domain capital investment companies can automate many unnecessary tedious tasks that could be handled by a machine allowing for more efficiency and less human error.

If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
</span>

My only suggestion is to at least have some rodo advisor course that they can sell to teach us there secrets thats it.

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
